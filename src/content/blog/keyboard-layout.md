I've started to use Vim Motions for a majority of my workflow, switching to Neovim as my main editor for many projects, using it in VSCode (I still use VSCode for web projects), the vimium extension in firefox and chrome and it's made moving around much quicker and intuitive. Also being on Linux a lot of apps have vim motion support such as Okular (a document viewer) and other apps like obsdian provide vim motion support out of the box. The switch has been great but I am kind of held back by my keyboard's layout. Having to use my pinky and stretch all the way to the corners of the keyboard for **ESC** and **CTRL** is just not practical so I've switched my keys around to help keep my fingers mostly around the home row.

This is what my layout looked like before

And this is what I've changed it to

![Keyboard After](images/KeyboardAfter.png)
I've switched my **CAPS LOCK** key with **ESC** so I can my left pinkie to press it rather than stretching my finger all the way to the top left corner. I also never use **CAPS LOCK** and instead just hold **SHIFT** so its pretty much useless to me.

Next I switched my **R-CTRL** with my **R-ALT** so I can use my right thumb to press **CTRL** and left thumb **ALT**. This keeps my thumbs on the bottom row and the rest of my fingers on the home row. I want to map **BACKSPACE** to **RIGHT-WIN** but can't find a way to do that.

This works well for my desktop setup with sway as I use my **WINDOWS** for window movement then **CTRL** and **ALT** for window specific movement. Check out more about my desktop setup [here](/blog/linux-setup)
